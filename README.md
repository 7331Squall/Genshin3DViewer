This is a little tool made to have a 3D reference of a cosplay on the move, with removable parts, while searching for materials for making it.

This code is poorly documented, although somewhat self-explanatory. You could put your own models into it, all you need to do is modify the Wriothesley.js file and every line that the doLoad function calls loads a model and generates a checkbox for it.

It's good enough for my purposes, but feel free to modify for your own intents.

> [!NOTE]
> Wriothesley model is the property of MiHoYo, HoYoVerse, Cognosphere or whatever they're calling themselves today.
> 
> I just imported the model on a old Blender version which still supported the MMD plugin, then exported it to a more recent one, separated the parts into separate objects and exported them to GLB format
